(stranded in Perpignan)",36,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/jyg79/help_me_reddit_youre_my_only_hope_stranded_in/,"Bonjour r/France! So, here's the story. I am in Perpignan this week for Visa pour L'image, an international photojournalism conference, if you know the city you'll no doubt recognise the name. I had arranged to stay with a friend who lives a few miles out of the city centre towards the coast, however, on arrival my friend informs me that (through no fault of his own, he has an assignment in Kosovo that is taking longer than expected) he will not be back in time to let me stay for the duration of the conference.

I didn't think this would be a problem as I have camping gear on the back of my bike and thought I would be able to find a campsite close by (close enough to cycle too) but so far my search has turned up nothing nearby. For tonight I have checked into the only hotel I could find that was open 24hrs but I can't afford it for the whole week and my funds are already dwindling.

Now I know this is a lot to ask of a stranger and I'm usually the last person to ask for help but I could really use some right now. I would be eternally grateful if anyone has a couch or a floor I could crash on (I'll literally sleep anywhere and I have an air mattress) in the area for as many nights as possible from now until the 4th or a garden perhaps where I can pitch a tent. Also any local knowledge of the area with regards to cheap places to stay and eat or any campsites I may have missed will be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR I'm in an unfamiliar town, speak barely passable French and my funds are dwindling. I'm more than a little nervous. Need somewhere, anywhere, to stay as my friend I planned to stay with has not made it back into the country yet...

Thanks for reading.",1970
709,1363123206.0,1a67hz,[modeste proposition] Idées pour /r/france.,35,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1a67hz/modeste_proposition_idées_pour_rfrance/,"Coucou.

J'ai cru remarquer que le style est peu personnalisé, un peu tristounet. Je voulais savoir ce que vous en pensez, y compris les autres modérateurs.


J'ai deux-trois idées :

- Créer une bannière au lieu d'un simple petit logo,sur le modèle de /r/frenchhistory ou d'autres.
(idées et propositions bienvenues)

- Intégrer une image à la sidebar qui pourrait être changée de temps en temps, représentative de la France (paysages, villes, tableaux, personnages). Avec éventuellement suggestion des utilisateurs. [idée piquée à /r/italy]

- Rendre le menu un peu plus mignon. Moi j'aimerais des fleurs, du rose et des princesses, mais sinon on peut aussi faire plus simple et juste redessiner un peu les titres de sous-parties en mettant un cadre autour, ce genre de détails.

- C'est soirée libre donc apportez vos idées, critiquez, etc.",1970
969,1297291207.0,fic13,Il y a 5 ans que j'ai decouvert ce text au-dessous du mur chez ma tante,33,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/fic13/il_y_a_5_ans_que_jai_decouvert_ce_text_audessous/,"[cross post from WTF](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/fhzzc/five_years_ago_my_parisian_aunt_asked_me_to_help/)

I studied abroad one semester in Paris, going in with terrible French and leaving with mediocre French. I stayed with my aunt, whom I had never met before, and who only shared French as a language with me. She was incredibly kind, and helped me reconnect with many relatives I did not know I even had.

In the last month I was there, my aunt  asked me to help her take down the apartment's wallpaper. She told me that originally when she came to rent at the building, she thought the walls were painted, not wallpapered, but was disappointed to find this wasn't the case when the management called her back with a newly-vacant apartment. So we bought some supplies, moved the furniture, and got to work.

After scraping off a few pieces, I started seeing marks underneath. Then letters. [Then this emerged.](http://i.imgur.com/mjPIl.jpg)

We were taken aback, but we kept scratching. Eventually, [we had cleared the whole wall.](http://i.imgur.com/JZqm3.jpg)

It was a scrawling letter, addressed both to a man's wife (ex wife? lover?) and his daughter. Some parts were angry, others sad, others manic and unintelligible. Many parts seemed to reference suicide. The image of a deep-sea diver, along with the phrase ""Tu n'as pas le droit"" (you don't have the right) appears to be an homage to [this French comic.](http://i.imgur.com/M7iYS.jpg)

I know the image quality is bad (only had a 3.1 MP camera back then), but some parts are quite clear including these magazine cutouts saying (roughly):

[You don't have the right. You stole our child. God will see to it that you pay for this one day.](http://i.imgur.com/VXk7C.jpg)

Other parts (correct my French if I'm wrong) say things like:

* ""One day, my dear child, you will understand. You'll know that I would have wished to see you grow up. You'll understand how your mother's savagery ruined me.""
* ""My beautiful daughter.... (something about happiness)... and me, who actually believed your mother loved me.""
* ""(something) I'm incredibly tired I want to... I want to sleep and... (something) my beautiful daughter. You must (something) this life.""  
* ""Your mother has no idea what she really is.""
* ""You were wonderful, I was so deeply happy. Despite everything, I still love you. **Goodbye.**""

This was profoundly sad, but provoked some curiosity. My aunt asked the neighbors if they knew anything about the previous tenant. They told her he was a quiet man, a political cartoonist. They said he kept to himself, then one day he disappeared.

I don't know anything more than that, but whenever I see wallpaper I think about that day in France and wonder who this man was and if he took his life or if he just left it behind.",1970
